- Threat Hunting & Incident Response  
- Digital Forensics (FTK, Autopsy, Memory Analysis)  
- Vulnerability Management & Pentesting  
- OSINT Investigations & Recon  
- GRC Fundamentals & Cyber Law Awareness

🧠 Tech I Speak:
`Python` • `Bash` • `C/C++`  
Kali Linux • Ubuntu • Windows (Log/Event Analysis)

🛠️ Tools I Wield:
Nmap • Wireshark • Metasploit • Burp Suite • Nessus  
Splunk • Autopsy • FTK Imager • ZAP • Maltego • Spiderfoot • Shodan • theHarvester • OSINT Framework
